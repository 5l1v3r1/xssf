##
# Conversion Notes:
# renamed command dispatcher
# configured load paths for plugin/xssf to hold lib and modules
#  this required a bit of hackery since Msf::Xssf namespace is loaded before we can $:.unshift the lib dir
# simplified lib paths and rewrote require statements in modules to match
##

##
# Conversion TODO:
# convert the model stuff into Mdm format
# convert XSSF server into an auxiliary/server/xssf module
#  allow for easy starts on new hosts, standardized config, and adding the XSS loop as a resource to existing servers a la browser autopwn
